# Fundametal of Networking
This covers chapter 13 from the book, Computer Systems: An Integrated  Approach to Architecture and Operating  Systems. It can also be used for the students who are taking cs 2200 in Georgia Tech.

Three touch points for operating system to facilitate the box to hook up the network:
- **socket library**: it provides an API for developing network application. Defining and implementing this API is the first touch point for the operating system to facilitate network.
- **protocal stack**: Messages generated by an application program have to reach the destination and it involves a myraid of issues. The protoccal stack addresses all these issues.
- **network device driver**: The computer connects to network via Network Interface Card (NIC) and network device driver interacts with this NIC.

## Basic terminology
### Host and network
A **host** is a computer that hooks on to the network and represented as an edge of the network. It can be either _client_ or _server_ by the role it is playing
A **network** is a composite of several networks. This collection of networks form the Internet.

### Inside the Network
1. A host plugs into a **cable modem** and access network
2. Cable modem connects to **Internet Service Provider (ISP)*** or **local area network (LAN)**
 - You may use ISP if you are at home and LAN if you are in school, office, or a dorm room.
 - REgional ISP knows how to connect with another regional ISP around the world.

### Router
A **router** sits in the core of network and route messages between ISP across the world. It has a series of queues that reside at input of the routers from source to destination.
Thereare 2 different packet flows on the Internet:
- **Queing delay**: In the presence of other traffic, a packet may experience delays on the packet.
- **Packet loss**: A packet that is full because of its finite-size, a packet may be dropped.

## Protocol Stack
A **protocol stack** is a the portion of the operating system that addresses the problems below:
1. Arbitrary message size and physical limitations of network packets (network protocal there is a maximum packet size and message size may not fit the size limitation.)
2. Out of order delivery of packets (There is no guarantee that the packets of the message will arrive in order by queueing delays and variety of paths they can take.)
3. Packet loss in the network 
4. Bit errors in transmission 
5. Queuing delays en route to the destination (Since the packets take several different networksbefore the destination, it is hard to predict this information.)
### Internet protocol layers

#### Application Layer
- Responsible for supporting network-based applications such as an instant messenger (IM), multi-player video games, P2P music/video sharing, web browser, electronic mail, and file transfer. 
- provide a common language for application level entities (clients, servers, and peers) to use for communicating with each other.
